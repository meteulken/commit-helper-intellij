## 🔑 API Keys & Privacy

Commit Helper does **not** provide or bundle any AI models.  
Instead, it connects to external APIs (**Gemini**, **Mistral**) using your **own API key**.

- You must obtain an API key from [Google AI Studio (Gemini)](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) or [Mistral](https://console.mistral.ai/api-keys).
- Keys are stored **locally and securely** via IntelliJ’s built-in [PasswordSafe](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/passwords.html).
- Your keys are **never sent anywhere else** — they are only used directly in API calls to the chosen provider.
- The plugin does **not** collect telemetry, analytics, or usage data.

⚠️ Usage of Gemini or Mistral is subject to their respective Terms of Service.
